# Restaurant Management System


## Overview

The Restaurant Management System is designed to streamline restaurant operations through two main components:

1. **Web Page (Restaurant)**: Provides the front-end interface for customers to interact with the restaurant's services.
2. **API (Restaurant API)**: Manages data and interactions on the back-end through a RESTful API.


## Project Structure

The project consists of two Django apps:

- **Restaurant**: The web application with user-facing components.
- **Restaurant API**: The backend API that handles various operations related to menu management, shopping cart, orders, table bookings, and user management.
